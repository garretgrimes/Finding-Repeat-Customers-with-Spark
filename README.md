# Finding-Repeat-Customers-with-Spark

In this notebook, I employed Spark and Spark SQL in conjunction with MLLib (Machine Learning Library) to delve deeper into customer data analysis. The primary objective was to predict potential new customers using unlabeled data. Using Spark SQL, I executed queries and transformations on the datasets. I utilized MLLib (a machine learning library in the Spark ecosystem) to train a logistic regression model to predict repeat customers. MLLib encompasses a wide range of algorithms and tools, making it ideal for building predictive models on big data.
